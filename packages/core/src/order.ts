 * Sequencing: the elements the candidate puts in the right order.

 * **The authored order is the order the candidate SEES, and each element says where it
 * belongs.** That is the whole design, and it is forced. If the author listed the elements
 * correctly and the compiler emitted them as authored, the answer would ship inside
 * `interaction` — and a graded delivery that withholds `validation` would still be handing the

 * deterministic scramble is invertible by anyone who knows the rule, and a random one would
 * reshuffle under the candidate on every recompile, because `PROG` recompiles on each response.
 *
 * So `assess [ position 2 ]` — key material inside `assess`, exactly where `correct` sits on an
 * option, a selection and a recognized answer.
