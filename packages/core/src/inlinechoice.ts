/**
 * A sentence whose holes are dropdowns: cutting it, and binding each hole to its options.
 *
 * Pure — no AST, no CPS, no compiler types — the same shape as `hottext.ts` and
 * `textentry.ts`, and for the same reason: the logic is worth testing on its own.
 *
 * The marker model is text-entry's, shared through `cutMarkers`, because a dropdown and a
 * typed blank are the same construct: a named hole that a marker positions. What differs is
 * only what fills it, and that is the whole design here — the answer to a dropdown is an
 * option the candidate SELECTED, so its key is `choice`'s (an identifier, per-option points, a
 * rationale on the option), while its position in the sentence is text-entry's.
 *
 * The two do not mix in one sentence. QTI keeps `textEntryInteraction` and
 * `inlineChoiceInteraction` apart, and a member word that took both `responses` and `options`
 * would let a blank be written half one way and half the other.
