# L0180 RAG Training Examples

113 example prompts for training a RAG model on L0180, the web-based assessment language —
covering multiple choice, true/false, multi-select, exact-set scoring, weighted scoring,
penalized distractors, presentation options, unscored polls, per-option rationale, clicking
sentences and words inside a passage, fill-in-the-blank including numeric answers and the form they must be written in, written
responses marked against a rubric, and multi-part items over a reading passage.

Each numbered line is a prompt in the author's own voice. Prompts describe WHAT to build,
never how to write it: an author asks for a question, not for a `choice [...]` program. When
L0180 grows further interaction types, this file grows categories with them.
